## 📂 About the Project

This project was built by recreating the **concept** of a music playlist, not copying an existing UI.  
The layout, structure, and logic were designed independently, with a focus on:

- One active audio source at a time
- Clear click-based interaction
- Responsive layout across screen sizes
- Simple and readable code structure
